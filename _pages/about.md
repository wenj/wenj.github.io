Iâ€™m a second year M.S. in Language Technologies (MLT) student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm fortunately advised by [Prof. Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/). My current research interests lie at multimodal perception, 3D scene understanding and unsupervised learning. Before joining CMU, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Hu](http://www.xlhu.cn/) and [Prof. Jianmin Li](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101225164517300815523/20101225164517300815523_.html). You can also find my [CV]() here.
